NAME
    Business::Address::POBox - Check whether an address looks like a P.O.Box

VERSION
    version 1.100820

SYNOPSIS
        use Business::Address::POBox;

        my $address = 'PF 34, 1010 Wien';
        if (Business::Address::POBox->new->is_pobox($address)) {
            # do something with the address
        }

DESCRIPTION
    This class tries to determine whether or not an string refers to a P.O.
    box. This is sometimes relevant if your business process, for legal
    reasons, needs a real address and not a P.O. box.

    It has predefined blacklists and whitelists that should catch most
    English and German P.O. box addresses, but you can modify these lists
    with the methods provided. Note that the entries are literal strings,
    not regular expressions.

METHODS
  new
        my $obj = Business::Address::POBox->new;
        my $obj = Business::Address::POBox->new(%args);

    Creates and returns a new object. The constructor will accept as
    arguments a list of pairs, from component name to initial value. For
    each pair, the named component is initialized by calling the method of
    the same name with the given value. If called with a single hash
    reference, it is dereferenced and its key/value pairs are set as
    described before.

  init
    Just calls "update()" in case the blacklist and/or whitelist was set
    during the "new()" call.

  update
    Call this method when you've changed the "whitelist()" or the
    "blacklist()" so the matcher knows about the changes.

  is_pobox
    This is the central method of this class. It takes a string argument and
    checks it against the whitelist and the blacklist. Returns a boolean
    value - true if the string passes the whitelist or is at least not
    caught by the blacklist, false if the string is caught by the blacklist.

  is_pobox_relaxed
    Like "is_pobox()", but once a string passes the whitelist, it is not
    checked against the blacklist anymore. That is, if a string matches the
    whitelist, it is valid. If not, it is checked against the blacklist - if
    it matches, it is invalid. If it matches neither whitelist nor
    blacklist, it is valid.
